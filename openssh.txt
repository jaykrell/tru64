WARNING: the operating system that you are using does not
appear to support getpeereid(), getpeerucred() or the
SO_PEERCRED getsockopt() option. These facilities are used to
enforce security checks to prevent unauthorised connections to
ssh-agent. Their absence increases the risk that a malicious
user can connect to your agent.

Is there a solution?
