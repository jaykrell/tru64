generally I have settled on:

configure CC=cc CFLAGS="-pthread -c99 -g -ieee" LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/lib -rpath $HOME/lib"

or gcc without c99 and m on ieee:
 configure CC=gcc CFLAGS="-pthread -g -mieee" LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/lib -rpath $HOME/lib"

(configure -prefix=$HOME, substitute accordingly)

gcc-3.4.6 and gcc-4.7.4 were easy enough to build.

While native cc might be "nice", do not avoid
trying gcc to get around some compile problems.
