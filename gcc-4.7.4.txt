We don't clearly need gcc 4.7.4.
It is the last release with support for Tru64 / OSF1.

Build it with gcc3?
 That worked, but I'm trying native cc too.
Patch gmp (see gmp.txt)

There were errors on the makeinfo commands, despite
having installed GNU makeinfo.

I edited those out of gcc/Makefile.

Vi add line breaks, so then I repaired that.

todo: Try installing nano or vim.
