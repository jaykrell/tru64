Depends on zlib?
  -I$HOME/include helps

Depends on GNU make?
  It seems so.

Out of tree builds do not work?
 It seems so.

 cc: Error: run-command.c, line 839: In this statement, "NSIG" is not declared. (undeclared)
                for (sig = 1; sig < NSIG; sig++) {

NSIG is behind #ifdef _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED 1 in /usr/include/signal.h but defining that seems to be trouble, so add:
 #define NSIG (SIGMAX+1) 
in run-command.c after all the #includes

 cc: Error: sequencer.c, line 2315: This leave statement is not within a try statement. (noleavetarg)
  leave:
 Add "#undef leave" after all the includes

builtin/receive-pack.c:
 also #undef leave after includes

Please consider avoiding this identifier "leave". It is trouble in some Windows environments also,
where it is #defined to be __leave, and the #undef fixes it there too. In both cases this is
an exception handling language extension for C.

There are warnings about setenv implicit declaration.
It is behind #ifdef _BSD in /usr/include/stdlib.h but #define _BSD seems to be trouble.
Ignore the warnings is probably ok.
Can also copy in the declaration.

I built git relatively late, so it could be depending on myriad sed, awk, etc.

TODO: Build in package into its own prefix, and then add to path only if needed.

Warning version mismatch for shared library libiconv.so
git-daemon depends on version osf.1 and libintl.so depends on version 2.0
Unresolved:
libintl_gettext
libintl_ngettext
libintl_textdomain
libintl_bindtextdomain
libintl_bind_textdomain_codeset

Rebuild with make NO_GETTEXT=1

cc: Warning: builtin/sparse-checkout.c, line 491: In this declaration, the enumerator "ns_uop_add" is not unique. (dupenum)
        ADD,
--------^

Wow.

$ cd /usr/include
$ grep ns_uop_add */*
arpa/nameser.h: ns_uop_add = 1,
arpa/nameser_compat.h:#define ADD               ns_uop_add

Three cheers for namespace pollution. :(

So change ADD to GIT_ADD ?

Unresolved:
strtoull

So make NO_STRTOULL=1 NO_GETTEXT=1 install
or for the impatient change strtoull in compat/strtoumax.c to strtoul, touch all other *.o
Must be some configure problem. And strtoull is in headers.
I didn't track this down.

./t/helper/test-progress.c

Change strtoull to strtoul.

and eh, make install fails:

install -d -m 755 '/usr/users/jay/bin'
Usage: install [-c dira] [-f dirb] [-i] [-M] [-m mode] [-u owner] [-g group] [-S] [-n dirc] [-o] [-s] file [dirx ...]
make: *** [Makefile:2986: install] Error 2

In Makefile, change:
INSTALL = install
to
INSTALL = installbsd

er, nope:
install: too many files specified -> -d -m 755 /usr/users/jay/bin

change it to random install-sh from other package:
INSTALL = /usr/users/jay/s/make-3.82/config/install-sh

There is surely a GNU install I haven't built yet.

Git is not useful without openssl.
Openssl requires a Perl update.
