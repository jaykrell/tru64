When compiling gcc, gcc-4.7.4, it common to hit makeinfo errors.

I though we could just skip makeinfo, like by setting
MAKEINFO=: but that hasn't worked.

The error:

The workaround I have settled on is:

vim gcc/Makefile:

Change these lines:

to just:
 Not reproing new, but look for MAKEINFO and change the
 rules to be empty.

As well,
 - System vi will insert newlines, breaking Makefiles randomly.
   Therefore build and use vim instead of vi.

 - Gcc maybe got stuck in a bootstrap loop due to editing Makefiles.
   And the last stage always fails debuginfo comparison anyway.
   So always configure gcc with -disable-bootstrap.
