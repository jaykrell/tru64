gcc3 is useful for building gcc4
It does not require gmp,mpfr,mpc.

gcc is very important because much software cannot be built with native cc.

Perhaps gcc3 suffces for most code also.

Maybe CFLAGS=-pthread -c99 is a good idea, but maybe not.
-c99 probably causes problems, it ends up passed to xgcc and errors.

Let's try:

    mkdir o
    cd o
    mkdir gcc-3.4.6
    cd    gcc-3.4.6
    nohup sh -c "CFLAGS=-pthread CC=cc $HOME/s/gcc-3.4.6/configure -prefix=$HOME/gcc-3.4.6 -verbose -disable-nls -disable-shared -enable-static && make && make install" &
    tail -f nohup.out

Do this after building GNU make and with GNU make in $PATH
