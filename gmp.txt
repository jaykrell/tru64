Some versions of gmp fail to compile with native cc.

Something about 0/0 to produce nan being a constant that cannot be evaluated.

Likely workaround:
 Compile gcc3 (3.4.6) first, which doesn't use gmp, with native cc.
 Then gcc4 with gmp with gcc3.

In particular, the sequence native cc to old gcc to newer gcc is not uncommon.
It is the sequence on HP-UX/HPPA where system cc is K&R only, compile gcc 3.3 with it,
and then newer gcc. (gcc 3.3 is the newest that does not require host ANSI C compiler).
It is also a sequence on SGI that has random old cc around.
