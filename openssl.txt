native cc "worked"?

but trying like:

PATH=$HOME/gcc-3.4.6/bin:$PATH
# Pending building gcc 4.
./Configuration \
  --prefix=$HOME \
  tru64-alpha-gcc \
  --debug \
  no-threads \
  no-shared \
  -DOPENSSL_USE_IPV6=0 \
  no-asm \
  --openssldir=$HOME \
  -Wl,-rpath=$HOME/lib \
  -g \
  -O0

When using native cc, assembly does not work, because -o does not work across directories.
This is easy to fix by cd'ing and running cc -c foo.S -o foo.o a few times, like three.

The system has IPv6 support but something in Python made me question it.

System vi editing the Makefile damages long lines. Avoid it.
