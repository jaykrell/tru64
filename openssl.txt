native cc "worked"?

but trying like:

PATH=$HOME/gcc-3.4.6/bin:$PATH
# Pending building gcc 4.
./Configure \
  --prefix=$HOME \
  tru64-alpha-gcc \
  --debug \
  no-threads \
  no-shared \
  -DOPENSSL_USE_IPV6=0 \
  no-asm \
  --openssldir=$HOME \
  -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/lib \
  -g \
  -O0

Comma after rpath, not equals.

When using native cc, assembly does not work, because -o does not work across directories.
This is easy to fix by cd'ing and running cc -c foo.S -o foo.o a few times, like three.

The system has IPv6 support but something in Python made me question it.

There is an error about && without operand, in rand-unix.c related to _POSIX_TIMERS.
#undef it and define it to be 1 slightly ahead of use.

System vi editing the Makefile damages long lines. Avoid it.
todo: vim

I understand OpenSSL is in the right here, but this line fails to compile with gcc 3.4.6,
something about no operand with the &&.

Can it be changed to, a few lines ahead:

/* Tru64/OSF1 defines _POSIX_TIMERS to be empty instead of positive. The support appears to be there. */
#if defined(__osf__) && defined(_POSIX_TIMERS)
#undef _POSIX_TIMERS
#define _POSIX_TIMERS 1
#endif

Or, I believe I saw an idiom checking for an empty value, like:

#ifdef _POSIX_TIMERS
#if _POSIX_TIMERS+0==0
#undef _POSIX_TIMERS
#define _POSIX_TIMERS 1
#endif
#endif

but I didn't try that.

Native cc didn't this this problem, for what it is worth.
