/*
 * Masks for B-Cache and Duplicate Tag Fields. (see section 4.1 of the
 * 						sable cpu spec)
 *
 * The Sable B-Cache is a direct-mapped physical write-back cache, with a
 * fixed 32 byte (hexaword) block size.  It supports the CBus snooping
 * protocol to allow for a multi processor implementation.
 *
 * Each cache block entry is made up of three storage element arrays.  The
 * control store, which is parity protected, contains the binary flags which
 * indicate whether a particular entry is valid, dirty, and/or shared.  The
 * tag store, which is also parity protected, contains the high order address
 * bits of the data currently stored in that particular cache block entry.
 * The data store, which is EDC protected, contains the cached data.
 * 
 * Control Flags:
 *   VALID	The entry is valid (tag and data are meaningful).
 *   DIRTY	The data store contains an updated copy of its main memory
 *		location.
 *   SHARED	The data store contains a copy of a main memory location which
 *		is also cached by another CBus node.  Writes to this location
 * 		must be write-through to maintain coherency.
 *   PARITY	Contains even parity over the contents of the control store.
 *
 * Tag Store:
 *   Contains the high order address bits <30:20> (<30:22> for 4Mb cache) of
 *   the memory location that currently resides in the cache entry.  Protected
 *   by a parity bit which maintains EVEN parity.  Parity is checked by the
 *   processor during every B-Cache probe cycle, and by the B-Cache controller
 *   during every Cbus2 initiated probe cycle.
 *
 * Data Store:
 *   Contains the actual data of the memory location that is cached.  A cache
 *   entry is made up of 8 longwords, each longword protected by 7 bits of
 *   EDC.  Physically the cache is only 4 longwords wide, so a cache block
 *   consists of 2 consecutive addresses aligned on a 32 byte block boundary.
 *   Error checking is performed whenever the processor hits the cache on a
 *   read and error checking and possibly correcting is performed whenever a
 *   Cbus2 read probe hits dirty, the victimization of a dirty location, or a
 *   masked processor write to a shared location.
 *
 * The B-Cache subsystem is manipulated by two different controllers.  The
 * first is the processor which will probe the taf field and, if hit, will
 * read or write data into the B-Cache.  The behavior of the processor
 * relative to the B-Cache is controlled/monitored by the processor registers
 * biu_stat, biu_addr, fill_addr, biu_ctl, and bc_tag.  The second is the
 * B-Cache controller.  It processes all miss traffic and CBus probe activity.
 * The behavior of the B-Cache controller is determined by the settings of the
 * B-Cache CSRs defined below.
 *
 * There is primary and secondary CSR space.  Primary CSR specs is used by
 * Sable systems, and secondary CSR space is used by Cobra systes.

 * clock is received from the CBus and used to generate an Interval Timer
 * Interrupt to each processor.  The Interval Timer Interrupt is local to each
 * CPU so that this interrupt will occur 180 degrees out of phase with the
 * other processor node.  The system generic SYSTEM EVENT INTERRUPT is
 * generated by an I/O halt request, an Operator Control Panel HALT request,
 * an enclosure event, or a power supply event.  The generic transaction error
 * signal C_ERR_L is generated by soft or hard errors related to data
 * transactions.
