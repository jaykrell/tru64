/*
 * This structure describes the swap status of an anonymous page.  Anonymous
 * pages are initially allocated without any swap (swap space will be
 * reserved if requested for user memory), and therfore the swap object will
 * be set to lazy.  pg_anon is set to the corresponding anonymous memory
 * descriptor.  Real swap space is allocated at pageout time and swap object
 * is filled in.  When page is freed after pageout this information is
 * transferred to the corresponding anon.  On pagein, the swap info. is
 * re-established for the new page.
 *
 * Kernel anonymous memory is handled in a slightly different manner.  For a
 * kernel pageable page swap and anonymous memory descriptors are allocated
 * at pageout time and it is moved to the swap object.  Until freed they stay
 * with the swap object.
 *
 * Page ownership is determined by the pg_object field of struct vm_page.
