/*
 * handler_intr_info structure.
 *
 * This generic structure is used to help improve cross-bus driver
 * independence, by defining an interrupt-info structure passed
 * in the ihandler_t structure at handler_add() time that has a format
 * that contains all the necessary information to add an intr. handler/isr
 * at driver configuration time.
 *
 * This structure and the associated call of handler_add() can be done
 * by static drivers as well as loadable drivers.  By using the
 * handler_add() interface, static drivers benefit by removing a code 
 * dependency in the sizer utility to generate a proper (target kernel) 
 * config file (since the driver isr name does not have to be known).
 *
 * Assumption(s): Controller- and/or bus-specific information not provided
 *		  in this data structure is contained in the controller-
 *		  or bus-specific data structure (or attached bus-specific
 *		  data structure) that the bus-specific handler_add*() 
 *		  function can extract to configure the isr properly.
 * 
 * Note: This data structure is a direct copy of the Turbo-Channel 
 * 	 tc_intr_info structure which provides binary compatibility with
 *	 legacy TC drivers, and source code compatibility across TC, PCI, &
 * 	 EISA drivers.
