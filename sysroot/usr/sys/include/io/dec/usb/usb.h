 * Configuration Descriptor - The configuration descriptor describes

 *
 * The descriptor describes the number of interfaces provided by the
 * configuration.  Each interface may operate independently.  For example,
 * an ISDN device might be configured with two interfaces, each providing
 * 64kBs bi-directional channels that have separate data sources or sinks

 * more endpoints.  An endpoint is not shared among interface within a
 * single configuration unless the endpoint is used by alternate settings
 * of the same interface.  Endpoints may be shared among interface that are
 * part of different configurations without this restriction.
 *
 * Once configured, devices may support limited adjustments to the

 * an isochronous endpoint's maximum packet size may also be adjusted.

/*
 * Interface Descriptor - This descriptor describes a specific interface
 * provided by the associated configuration.  A configuration provides one
 * or more interfaces, each with its own endpoint descriptors describing
 * a unique set of endpoints within the configuration.  When a configuration
 * supports more than one interface, the endoints for a particular interface
 * immediately follow the interface descriptor in the data returned by the
 * Get Configuration request.  An interface descriptor is always returned
 * as part of a configuration descriptor.  It cannot be directly accessed
 * with a Get or Set Descriptor request.
 *
 * An interface may include alternate settings that allow the endoints and/or
 * their characteristics to be varied after the device has been configured.
 * The default setting for an interface is always alternate setting zero.
 * The Set Interface request is used to select an alternate setting or to
 * return to the default setting .  The Get Interface request returns the
 * selected alternate setting.
 *
 * Alternate settings allow a portion of the device configuration to be
 * varied while other interfaces remain in operation.  If a configuration
 * has alternate settings for one or more of its interfaces, a spearate
 * interface descriptor and its associated endpoints are included for each
 * setting.
 *
 * If a device configuration supported a single interface with two alternate
 * settings, the configuration descriptor would be followed by an interface
 * descriptor with the IntefaceNumber and AlternaSetting fields set to zero
 * and then the endoint descriptors for that setting, followed by another
 * interface descriptor and its associated endpoint descriptors.  The second
 * interface descriptor's InterfaceNumber field would also be set to zero,
 * but the AlternateSetting field of the second interface descriptor would
 * be set to one.
 *
 * If an interface only uses endpoint zero, no endpoint descriptors follow
 * the interface descriptor and the interface identifies a request interface
 * that uses the default pipe attached to endpoint zero.  In this case the
 * NumEndpoints field shall be set to zero.
 *
 * An interface descriptor never includes endpoint zero in the number of
 * endpoints.
