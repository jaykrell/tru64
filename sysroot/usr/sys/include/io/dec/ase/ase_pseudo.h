/*
 * Support for LSM devices that are under control of DECsafe ASE.
 *
 * DECsafe needs file systems' devices to have identical dev_t's on all hosts
 * in the ASE.  Since LSM doesn't guarantee that /dev/vol/dgfoo/volbar
 * will have the same major,minor numbers on host_A and host_B, ASE crates
 * pseudodevices /dev/ase_XXX (which *do* have like dev_t's) and provides a
 * driver for them, /dev/ase, to implement a mapping between an LSM file
 * system and its pseudodevice.  Only LSM devices that belong to an ASE
 * are mapped.
 *
 * ASE creates (destroys) map entries with the CONFIG (DECONFIG) calls when
 * it starts (stops) a service on a host.  To see which LSM device (if any)
 * the pseudodevice /dev/ase_015 is mapped to, open /dev/ase in the usual way
 * and load /dev/ase_015's dev_t into a struct ase_config, then pass this in
 * an ioctl using ASE_ASE2LSM_CMD.  If the result is ESUCCESS, the
 * corresponding LSM device's dev_t will have been copied into the map_dev
 * field of your struct.
