 *	Field			Comment
 *	-----			-------
 *	f_flag			incore lock (but FREAD/FWRITE are read-only)
 *	f_type			read-only
 *	f_count			incore lock
 *	f_msgcount		incore lock
 *	f_cred			read-only
 *	f_ops			read-only
 *	f_data			read-only
 *	f_offset		i/o lock
 *	f_io_lock		incore lock
 *	f_io_waiters		incore lock
 *
 * A read-only field is one set during the allocation process; no other
 * processor or thread within the same task knows about the file structure
 * yet so the values in the field don't matter while the structure is
 * being allocated.  After allocation and initialization, the value in
 * such a field never changes until the structure is de-allocated.
 *
 * The f_io_lock serializes I/O through a shared file structure.  Programs
 * that naively expect to fork and read or write streams will receive non-
 * overlapping, unduplicated input and generate non-overlapping, unduplicated
 * output (although possibly interleaved between "atomic" i/o calls).  The
 * f_io_lock accomplishes this purpose by preventing f_offset from being
 * changed between the time the I/O request is initiated and the time
 * it completes.  Although the f_io_lock is provided at the file layer, the
 * lock is used at the discretion of the lower-level fileops.  In the vnode
 * layer, this lock is used to serialize access through plain files and
 * directories but not through character-special files, symbolic links
 * or sockets.  In the latter two cases, f_offset has no meaning.  We do
 * not guarantee I/O on character-special files because device drivers
 * may have additional constraints beyond the knowledge of the file layer.
 * For example, the terminal driver must be permitted to do the job of
 * sorting out competing claims on a terminal:  if we used the f_io_lock,
 * processes sharing file structures would not be able to do output while
 * one of their number has a read outstanding on the terminal.
 *
 * The f_io_lock has one other important use:  it serializes F_SETFL
 * operations on the same file structure.  The ordinary f_incore_lock
 * does not suffice because the flags word is modified in one routine
 * but its value must be guaranteed to remain constant until it is used
 * in another.
 *
 * Finally, the file structure credentials pointer never changes during
 * the working lifetime of a file structure.  Because routines that use
 * file structures must increase their reference counts, there is no way
 * for the credentials to be deallocated while a system call is in progress.
 * For this reason, it is possible to pass the file structure's credentials
 * pointer to lower-level routines without incrementing the credentials'
 * reference count.
