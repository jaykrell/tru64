/*
 *                       The Auxiliary Vector
 *
 * AT_NULL	The auxiliary vector has no fixed length; instead its
 * 		last entry's a_type member has this value.
 * 
 * AT_IGNORE	This type indicates the entry has no meaning.  The
 * 		corresponding value of a_un is undefined.
 * 
 * AT_EXECFD	exec() or exec_with_loader() may pass control to an
 * 		interpreter program.  When this happens, the system
 * 		places either and entry of type AT_EXECFD or one of
 * 		type AT_PHDR in the auxiliary vector.  The entry for
 * 		type AT_EXECFD uses the a_val member to contain a file
 * 		descriptor open to read the application program's
 * 		object file.
 * 
 * AT_PHDR	Under some conditions, the system creates the memory
 * 		image of the application program before passing
 * 		control to the interpreter program.  When this
 * 		happens, the a_ptr member of the AT_PHDR entry tells
 * 		the interpreter where to find the program header table
 * 		in the memory image.  If the AT_PHDR entry is present,
 * 		entries of types AT_PHENT, AT_PHNUM, and AT_ENTRY must
 * 		also be present.  AT_EXEC_LOADER_FILENAME
 * 
 * AT_PHENT	The a_val member of this entry holds the size, in
 * 		bytes, of one entry in the program header table to
 * 		which the entry points.
 * 
 * AT_PHNUM	The a_val member of this entry holds the number of
 * 		entries in the program header table to which the
 * 		AT_PHDR entry points.
 * 
 * AT_PAGESZ	If present, this entry's a_val member gives the system
 * 		page size, in bytes.  The same information also is
 * 		available through sysconf().
 * 
 * AT_BASE	The a_ptr member of this entry holds the base address
 * 		at which the interpreter program was loaded into
 * 		memory.
 * 
 * AT_FLAGS	If present, the a_val member of this entry holds
 * 		one-bit flags.  Bits with undefined semantics are set
 * 		to zero.  Currently, no flag definitions exist for
 * 		this entry.  Nonetheless, bits under the 0xff000000
 * 		mask are reserved for system semantics.
 * 
 * AT_ENTRY	The a_ptr member of this entry holds the entry poiint
 * 		of the application program to which the interpreter
 * 		program should transfer control.
 * 
 * AT_EXEC_FILENAME
 * 		The a_ptr member of this entry holds a pointer to a
 * 		character array that contains the filename as passed
 * 		to exec() or exec_with_loader().
 * 
 * AT_EXEC_LOADER_FILENAME
 * 		If present, the a_ptr member of this entry holds a
 * 		pointer to a character array that contains the
 * 		filename of the loader as passed to
 * 		exec_with_loader(), or the filename of the default
 * 		loader, if NULL was passed to exec_with_loader() or
 * 		exec() was invoked.
 * 
 * AT_EXEC_LOADER_FLAGS
 * 		If present, the a_val member of this entry holds
 * 		one-bit flags intended for use by the loader.  Bits
 * 		with undefined semantics are set to zero.  Currently,
 * 		no flag definitions exist for this entry.
 * 		Nonetheless, bits under the 0xff000000 mask are
 * 		reserved for system semantics.
