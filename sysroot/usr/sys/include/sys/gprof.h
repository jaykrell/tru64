     * struct phdr - the header of a standard gmon.out file.
     *
     * A standard gmon.out consists of 
     *  1. one of these struct phdr headers.
     *  2. an array of HISTCOUNTER samples whose size is 
     *     (ncnt - sizeof(struct phdr)) bytes and which represents 
     *     the discretized program counter values from monstartup(2).
     *  3. a series of struct rawarc, for each caller/callee pair.
     * The header's lpc and hpc values are the low and high addresses
     * covered by the array of samples.
     *
     *				NOTE
     *				====
     *
     * Since the V4.0 release of Digital UNIX, programs compiled with the
     * -pg flag have written out a gmon.out file in the new, self-describing,
     * extensible Profiling Data format, using <cmplrs/pdf.h> and libpdf.a.
     * Files in this Profiling Data format can be converted to the standard
     * format with the pdtostd(1) command, and they can be examined with the
     * pddump(1) command. They can be processed using the <cmplrs/pdf.h> API,
     * but tools doing this should be careful to access all records and fields
     * strictly by name, and to allow for new record and field names to be
     * added in future releases. The API makes this easy to achieve.
