 * unaligned-access warnings or having to compile with special switches
 * to generate code that handles unaligned data (but tends to be slower).
 * Group similarly sized fields together for best packing density when aligned.
 *
 * The MAP flags control whether an input/output file is memory mapped.
 * PDF_NOMAP should be selected for input/output to a pipe.
 * PDF_MAP causes the input or output file to be memory mapped.
 * The default values are PDF_ALIGN and PDF_MAP.
 *
 * The PDF_READ_WRITE flag allows a PDF_ARRAY or PDF_VARRAY field read from
 * an input file to be modified in place and for PDF_SCALAR fields read from
 * an input file to be modified using pdf_update_field(), so long as the
 * file was opened for read and write. The PDF_SHARED flag must also be
