 * Synopsis
 *   #include <alloca.h>
 *   void *alloca(integral_types);
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * This header is to be included if the intrinsic version of alloca()
 * is desired. The intrinsic version is more efficient in that space
 * is allocated/deallocated off the runtime stack rather than the heap
 * like the libc version does.  See also alloca(3).
 *
 * C++ users:
 *
 * DEC C++ versions prior to V5.3 do not support the intrinsic version
 * of alloca().  Use of pre-V5.3 versions of DEC C++ will result in a
 * compilation warning regarding the #pragma intrinsic below.  However,
 * the prototype for alloca() below is correct and will resolve to the
 * alternate standard C library version of alloca() under pre-V5.3 DEC
 * C++ versions, despite the warning.
