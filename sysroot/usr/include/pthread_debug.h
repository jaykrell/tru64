/*
 *			GENERAL NOTES ON USING THIS HEADER
 *
 * The header <pthread_debug.h> describes the functional interface and data
 * structures used to communicate with the DECthreads debug assistant (we'll
 * generally refer to it as "the assistant").
 *
 * To use the debug assistant, a debugger will compile (one or more modules)
 * with this header file, and link with the assistant library. The facilities
 * in this debugging system are designed to work with a mechanism such as the
 * Digital UNIX "proc" filesystem, or analysis of a saved core file, where the
 * multithreaded process being debugged (the "debuggee", or "target") lives in
 * a separate address space, not directly accessible by the assistant. Thus,
 * all memory references are made through "callbacks" supplied by the "client"
 * debugger (or any analysis tool utilizing this library).
 *
 * *** DECthreads "core" symbol table hook:
 *
 * In order to navigate within the address space of the multithreaded process,
 * the assistant relies on a special "symbol table" linked into the DECthreads
 * library (that is, libpthread.so on Digital UNIX, or PTHREAD$RTL.EXE on
 * OpenVMS). This symbol table, identified by the symbolic name
 * __pthread_dbg_symtable, tells the assistant how to find the various "root"
 * data structures necessary to identify threads, synchronization objects, and
 * other data. The assistant has no direct access to the symbol table of the
 * process being debugged, so it relies on the debugger to supply the address
 * of __pthread_dbg_symtable. The address is one of the arguments to the
 * pthreadDebugContextInit entry point, which must be called before using any
 * other debug assistant functions.
 *
 * It may also be noted that the debugger may look for __pthread_dbg_symtable
 * symbol to determine whether the target process may be multithreaded, before
 * attempting to initialize a debug assistant context for that process. At the
 * very least, be aware that the assistant currently cannot initialize
 * (pthreadDebugContextInit will fail) for any process that does not have a
 * visible __pthread_dbg_symtable symbol. In the future, we will try to work
 * with the kernel and debuggers to devise a better way to "hook" into the
 * target process, and we'd like to remove the need for
 * __pthread_dbg_symtable.
 *
 * *** Object caching and SUSPEND/RESUME callbacks:
 *
 * For efficiency, the assistant caches "objects" that it references in the
 * target process. However, because the target process is asynchronous, and
 * may be running simultaneously in many cases, the assistant cannot count on
 * the data remaining static. Therefore, it generally uses the cache to
 * efficiently LOCATE the remote object, and reads the actual target process
 * memory to "validate" the object. This validation can be avoided if and only
 * if the assistant can know that the process has been unable to run since the
 * object was last validated. It knows this, for example, while the debugger
 * traverses the list of threads, because pthreadDebugThdSeqInit suspends the
 * target process, which is resumed only when pthreadDebugThdSeqDestroy is
 * called. There are several important consequences to this assumption:
 *
 *  * Operation in contexts where the assistant has not itself suspended the
 *    process do not assume that the debugger has suspended the target
 *    process. If the debugger wishes to take full advantage of caching in all
 *    contexts, the debugger should always use the pthreadDebugSuspend and
 *    pthreadDebugResume functions -- even though all they do is invoke the
 *    debugger callback. The functions allow the assistant to know when the
 *    debugger has suspended process execution.
 *
 *  * If you supply a SUSPEND callback, it must actually ensure that the
 *    process is suspended before it returns. If it cannot suspend the
 *    process, it must return an error status. If the SUSPEND callback
 *    returns with success status (0), while the process is not actually
 *    suspended, the debug assistant's cache may become inconsistent. This
 *    will result in confusion of the debug client and the users. (You may,
 *    for example, see objects that no longer exist.)
 *
 * *** A few words about kernel threads and user threads
 *
 * In general, the debugger should endeavor to ignore kernel threads. It may,
 * however, sometimes be useful to have a mode that works with kernel threads
 * and ignores user threads. You should rarely attempt to deal with both user
 * and kernel threads simultaneously. For example, don't try to hold all other 
 * kernel threads while single stepping a user thread -- instead, hold all
 * other user threads.
 *
 * Beware that procfs may sometimes show a large number of kernel threads.
 * Generally, a DECthreads process will have one kernel thread for each
 * physical processor available to the process, plus one for the internal
 * "manager thread". Threads created in "system contention scope" (SCS) will
 * each have a private kernel thread. There may also be a number of kernel
 * threads that were previously used, and later destroyed. These are cached by
 * the kernel against future need. The kernel cache will be trimmed
 * approximately every 20 seconds by a routine that runs in the context of the
 * DECthreads "manager thread". (Note: the manager thread is used both by the
 * DECthreads library, in user mode context, and by the kernel, in kernel
 * context.)
 *
 * *** Identification of user thread ID from kernel thread:
 *
 * When a debugger takes a trap, it must usually determine the current thread
 * ID. When using the proc filesystem, the debugger can acquire a struct
 * prstatus structure for the current kernel thread, read the pr_teb member,
 * fetch from that address in the target process a block of memory of size
 * "sizeof(struct pthreadTeb_t)", and read the sequence member from the
 * resulting structure. However, there are special cases during process
 * initialization when this method will not work, because the TEB pointer is
 * only set when execution reaches the libc initialization (and is then
 * changed to a "true TEB" when DECthreads is initialized). (Note that in this
 * case, the correct thread ID is always "1".) Instead, you might want to
 * consider using pthreadDebugKidToId, which converts a kernel thread ID to a
 * user thread ID, and let the assistant do all the "grunt work" (even though
 * most of the work is done via the KTHDINFO and GETMEM callbacks). (You could
 * also supply the SPECKTHD callback and use pthreadDebugGetSpecialThread.)
 *
 * *** The SPECKTHD callback:
 *
 * For the most part, SPECKTHD is required only if the debugger plans to
 * utilize the pthreadDebugGetSpecialThread function. However, the assistant
 * will also use SPECKTHD (if available) to enhance the output of the "thread"
 * command (pthreadDebugCmd parser). Specifically, it will display ">" for the
 * current thread and "*" for the trap thread in the "thread -1" columnar
 * output format. It may be used in additional places (if available) for
 * various reasons, but we do not currently expect to require implementation
 * of the SPECKTHD callback.
 *
 * *** Interactions with proc filesystem:
 *
 * When you PRRUN, or PRSTEP, a process, after changing the HOLD state of user
 * mode threads, (especially after HOLDing them), you should always use the
 * additional flag PRRESCHED. This causes the kernel to generate a special
 * upcall for each kernel thread allowing the DECthreads scheduler to preempt
 * the HELD user thread before it can continue executing user instructions.
 * Without PRRESCHED, some HELD threads may continue to run. Also, beware that
 * HOLDing user threads does not work reliably prior to Digital UNIX 4.0D
 * patch kit 3 (released January, 1999).
 *
 * *** Something approximating release notes:
 *
 *    *** V0 interface
 *
 *	The V0 interface was the originally released Debug Assistant, part of
 *	DECthreads version 3.13, and shipped with Digital UNIX 4.0 and OpenVMS
 *	7.0. There was no public header for this interface, though the private
 *	header was usually known (and distributed) as <pthdbg.h>.
 *
 *	The V0 PTHREAD_DEBUG_VERSION value was 0x0313c001, rather than 0. This
 *	scheme was scrapped for V1, setting PTHREAD_DEBUG_VERSION to 1.
 *
 *	Many V0 interfaces had substantially different names than the V1 and
 *	later.
 *
 *    *** V1 interface
 *
 *	Released with DECthreads version 3.14, on Digital UNIX 4.0D, OpenVMS
 *	7.2. The <pthread_debug.h> header is shipped with the O/S kit. (But
 *	read the warnings carefully before using it!)
 *
 *	Many function names were changed for greater consistency, putting all
 *	the "object" designations towards the front. All of the old entry
 *	points remain for binary compatibility.
 *
 *	New callbacks were added: KTHDINFO and SPECKTHD. (Actually, V0 had
 *	defined the KTHDINFO, but hadn't defined the information structure
 *	associated with it.)
 *
 *	Most of the informational structures were changed substantially,
 *	and register info was changed from arrays to structures.
 *
 *	When V0 clients attach to the debug assistant, all input and output
 *	structures are translated to/from V1 internal form.
 *
 *	Porting from V0 to V1 may be a substantial amount of effort, but will
 *	gain significant new information.
 *
 *    *** Digital UNIX 4.0D, patch kit 3 (DECthreads 3.14-131)
 *
 *	Substantial changes to repair HOLD and UNHOLD, particularly of threads
 *	that may be concurrently executing on another processor. (Though some
 *	race conditions were observed even on a uniprocessor.) As a result,
 *	the behavior of, in particular, the pthreadDebugThdHold function was
 *	substantially changed in many cases. The ESRCH error was introduced to
 *	indicate a TERMINATED thread, which cannot be held. (The ESRCH error
 *	was arguably a bad idea, since it could retroactively change the
 *	behavior of existing V0 and V1 clients. A later release will remedy
 *	this by silently ignoring the TERMINATED thread and returning 0 for
 *	V0 and V1 clients.)
 *
 *   *** Digital UNIX 4.0D, patch kit 3, and OpenVMS 7.2
 *
 *	The SUSPEND and RESUME callbacks, and the WRITE callback, are now
 *	optional, regardless of client interface version. These may be
 *	omitted, for example, when the source of data is a core file, where
 *	those functions have no meaning. (OpenVMS SDA always omits them,
 *	because it supports only an asynchronous read-only connection.) But
 *	beware that some results are unreliable if SUSPEND and RESUME are not
 *	made available for a "live" process, since many operations cannot be
 *	completed "atomically". If you supply SUSPEND or RESUME, you must
 *	supply both.
 *
 *	You need not supply MALLOC or FREE callbacks; malloc and free will be
 *	used directly. If you supply either, you must supply both.
 *
 *    *** V2 interface
 *
 *	Part of DECthreads version 3.15. Released with Digital UNIX 4.0D,
 *	patch kit 4, Compaq Tru64 UNIX 4.0F, and Tru64 UNIX 5.0.
 *
 *	When you connect to a session with pthreadDebugContextInit, you may
 *	set some flags in the high end of the "version" member in the
 *	pthreadDebugCallbacks_t structure. These flags are defined in the
 *	pthreadDebugInitFlag_t enum, and are documented at the top of this
 *	header file.
 *
 *	New fields were added to the TSD (key address), RWL (writer ID, and
 *	reader count), and THREAD (creator interface) structures. Also, the
 *	THREAD info structure was substantially rearranged to give better
 *	and less ambiguous information about a thread's blocking state. All
 *	blocking state is now segregated into a "block" union containing
 *	appropriate information for each type of blocking state. Note that
 *	the blocking information is now filled in for READY and RUNNING
 *	threads as well as BLOCK threads. When a thread is readied, its prior
 *	blocking state remains until it begins to run, and that information
 *	can sometimes be useful in debugging. (E.g., the ready thread was
 *	previously blocked on condition variable 3.) In some cases when a
 *	thread is interrupted (e.g., by a ^C under ladebug), the blocking
 *	state also remains intact while the thread processes the signal; you
 *	can now see that the current thread was previously blocked, and why.
 *	Also, the kernel blocking state for UNIX, in addition to the habitat
 *	and syscall numbers (which are hard to translate without access to
 *	the OS source code), is now represented as strings. (Note that the
 *	habitat string will be empty if the habitat is 0, the "normal"
 *	habitat; others are named.) The syscall names don't always directly
 *	correspond to the user-visible libc stub names, but most are close
 *	enough to determine what's going on. Also note that the "process
 *	shared" synchronization object blocking functions are reported as
 *	kernel blocking states, but do not have habitat and syscall numbers.
 *
 *	Sequence traversal routines were added for TSD keys. (These routines
 *	can be used by version 0 and version 1 clients, but the entry points
 *	didn't exist on earlier versions of the Debug Assistant and aren't
 *	declared in earlier versions of the header file.)
 *
 *	There are some rudimentary and preliminary routines to process and
 *	format a DECthreads trace stream. Some are currently nonfunctional
 *	(and will fail with ENOSYS). The others are not intended to be
 *	self-evident, and are not well documented. (Even by the loose
 *	standards of this header file.)
 *
 *	There is a new event, TOOLREPORT, which will be used by the Visual
 *	Threads tool to invoke a debugger breakpoint if a debugger is attached
 *	that cares. The first argument is a string to be printed for the user.
 *	The second is a command string. The syntax of the command string is
 *	"undefined", but probably would be based on the ladebug command syntax
 *	and likely ignored by any other debugger. (Note that this event can be
 *	used by version 0 or version 1 clients, but the event will be accepted
 *	only when running with a version 2 Debug Assistant. Some unreleased
 *	version 1 Debug Assistants, such as the one in "Digital UNIX X5.0
 *	EFT1", also recognize this event.)
 *
 *	Correct 4.0D-3's regression in adding ESRCH errors for version 0
 *	clients that attempt to HOLD/UNHOLD terminated threads. Version 0 (and
 *	1) clients will receive the status 0. Version 2 clients will receive
 *	EINVAL.
 *
 *	Version 0 and version 1 interfaces silently ignore HOLD/UNHOLD
 *	requests for internal DECthreads threads. (Those with "negative"
 *	sequence numbers.) Version 2 clients will receive EPERM errors.
 *
 *    *** V3 interface
 *
 *	Part of DECthreads version 3.16. Released with Tru64 UNIX 5.0A,
 *	and 4.0G (?). The code is also available with the "bl15" patch kits
 *	for 4.0D, 4.0E, and 4.0F.
 *
 *	The use of time structures has been changed for consistency and to
 *	reduce ambiguity across various time_t models. (Tru64 UNIX now
 *	supports both a 32-bit time_t and a 64-bit time_t.) The new type is
 *	pthreadDebugTimespec_t.
 *
 *	The pthreadDebugMutInfo_t structure contains a new "depth" field to
 *	record the "recursion depth" of a recursive lock. The existing flag
 *	PTHREAD_DEBUG_MUT_PSHARED is now set when appropriate, though full
 *	support for pshared synchronization objects will be in a later
 *	version. A new flag, PTHREAD_DEBUG_MUT_TRACED, tells whether the
 *	mutex is marked for tracing. The flags will be set for clients of
 *	old versions, as well.
 *
 *	A new flag, PTHREAD_DEBUG_THD_DETACH, records that the target thread
 *	of a pthreadDebugThdGetInfo call is detached. The layout of the
 *	structure has not changed, and the new flag will be set for clients
 *	connected using older versions.
 *
 *	The _PSHARED flags are also set now for condition variable and
 *	read-write lock info. Again, full support for pshared synchronization
 *	requires additional client and operating system support and will be
 *	in a future version.
 *
 *    *** V4 interface
 *
 *	Part of DECthreads version 3.18-108.
 *
 * 	Adds new pthreadDebugThreadInfo_t fields to show the thread's current
 * 	VP association. This can be used to determine where the thread is
 * 	currently running. New flags specify whether the thread is BOUND or
 * 	ATTACHED to the VP's RAD.
 *
 *    *** DECthreads V3.19 (extension to V4 interface)
 *
 *	Added pthreadDebugThdHoldOthers and pthreadDebugThdUnholdOthers to
 *	make life (or at least using threads) just a bit simpler for debuggers
 *	by simplifying a few steps of "the breakpoint dance". With these, all
 *	threads but the breakpoint (target) thread can be held (to allow the
 *	target to be stepped over a breakpoint) and later resumed without
 *	needing to traverse the list of all threads itself. Currently, I
 *	expect relatively little (if any) performance advantage over
 *	traversing the thread sequence and holding/unholding each, but this
 *	new interface allows future performance optimizations between the
 *	thread library and debug assistant.
 */

/*
 * MACROS
 */

/*
 * The following error numbers (as defined by <errno.h>) may be returned as
 * the value of any debug assistant interface to indicate status. Client
 * callback routines are also expected to report the outcome by returning
 * error numbers. The following are the error numbers used by the assistant,
 * and their usual meaning. Callbacks should follow these guidelines if
 * possible.
 *
 *	ESUCCESS (0)	Successful completion
 *	ENOENT		End of traversal sequence (no more)
 *	ENOTSUP		Function not supported (usually callback error)
 *	EINVAL		Invalid parameter (sometimes, "thread in wrong state")
 *	ESRCH		ID does not represent a thread
 *	ENOMEM		Insufficient memory
 *	EPERM		Unable to perform operation (priv, ownership)
 *	EAGAIN		Operation cannot be performed right now (try again)
 *	ENOSYS		Not supported
 *	EBUSY		Operation cannot be performed: object is busy
 *	ECHILD		Broken association between parts of sync. object
 *	EFAULT		Internal addressing error
 *	EVERSION	Incompatible trace file version
 *	ESHUTDOWN	pthreadDebugCmd("exit")
 *
 * Note that, in most cases, errors returned by a callback routine cause the
 * debug assistant to immediately abort the current operation and return the
 * callback's error status to the client. There are some cases where the debug
 * assistant may be able to continue operation, or attempt an alternative. We
 * recognize that simply passing through the callback status is not
 * necessarily useful or informative to the client, and may cause confusion.
 * This situation, though, is unlikely to change at this late date.
 */

/*
 * These flags can be logically OR-ed into PTHREAD_DEBUG_VERSION (when
 * connecting with the v1 interface or higher) to affect how the connection is
 * made.
 *
 * PTHREAD_DEBUG_FLAG_PASSIVE:
 *
 *	Normally, when a debugger connects, pthreadDebugContextInit writes
 *	into the debuggee process to register the connection. (Tracing tools
 *	can ask about the connection.) Only one debugger (we think) can
 *	usefully attach to a given process: for example, they would need to
 *	coordinate interpretation of the event breakpoints, and any
 *	modifications to the process state.
 *
 *	PTHREAD_DEBUG_FLAG_PASSIVE allows a tool (e.g., VT) to attach without
 *	registering the connection.
 *
 * PTHREAD_DEBUG_FLAG_NOUPDATE:
 *
 *	Normally, when certain queries are made, the debug assistant may
 *	update information in the target process. For example, one of the
 *	thread information fields is a stack highwater mark; this data, part
 *	of the thread control block, is updated by the assistant so that
 *	repeated queries will return more useful information. Setting the
 *	PTHREAD_DEBUG_FLAG_NOUPDATE on connection will prevent these updates.
 *
 *	Note that setting both PASSIVE and NOUPDATE is not the same as making
 *	a connection "read-only" by omitting the WRITE callback. The flags
 *	just prevent the debug assistant from writing data on its own; the
 *	client is still allowed to make calls that request modifications.
 *
 *	Note also that the debug assistant will continue to rely on the
 * 	SUSPEND and RESUME callbacks, which allow "atomic" access to data in
 *	the threaded process. The "passivity" of such a connection can be
 *	debated, but, if the client desires truly a truly passive connection,
 *	and is prepared to deal with the data inconsistencies, it's possible
 *	to omit the SUSPEND and RESUME callbacks. (As OpenVMS SDA does.)
 *
 * PTHREAD_DEBUG_FLAG_UPCALLS:
 *
 *	Digital UNIX two-level scheduling involves a special communication
 *	path from the kernel out into the user-mode scheduler, called an
 *	upcall. Although similar in some ways to signal delivery, an upcall is
 *	something different. While the standard exc_remote_virtual_unwind
 *	routine in libc can be used to "walk" a stack containing upcalls, any
 *	debugger that doesn't use this routine, or have similar private logic,
 *	will be unable to find the user program state "underneath" an upcall
 *	frame. Because most existing debuggers do not use the standard
 *	routine, nor have similar logic, programmers may be unable to
 *	determine what a thread is actually doing (the stack traceback will
 *	appear to end at the upcall).
 *
 *	In order to avoid this confusion, the debug assistant, by default (and
 *	unconditionally for debuggers using the original "v0" interface) will
 *	"hide" upcall frames when returning (or setting) registers. Because
 *	the debugger won't see the upcall frames, the programmer won't be
 *	confused. There are complications involved, however, and a debugger
 *	that can support upcall frames may wish to avoid the extra
 *	indirection. (Also, thread library developers are extremely limited by
 *	upcall hiding, because the debugger cannot "see" a large chunk of
 *	thread library code.)
 *
 *	An "upcall-saavy" debugger that won't be confused by upcall frames may
 *	set PTHREAD_DEBUG_FLAG_UPCALLS to prevent the assistant from hiding
 *	upcalls.

/*
 * Type defining information returned about a thread.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1) The "sequence" field is traditionally reported as a signed number when
 *    the PTHREAD_DEBUG_THD_INTERNAL flag is set, even though the sequence
 *    number is unsigned.
 * 2) Even when the state is "RUNNING", the thread may have a substate of
 *    "MUTEX", "CV", "TIMED_CV", etc. In such case, the "condition" and/or
 *    "mutex" fields (Id of the synchronization object on which the thread is
 *    waiting) MAY or MAY NOT be non-zero. This situation means that the
 *    thread is "about to wait" or "in the process of waking".
 * 3) The "locks" field can count only the non-default mutex types held by the
 *    thread -- recursive or errorcheck mutexes, pshared mutexes, and priority
 *    inheritance or priority ceiling mutexes. The thread may additionally
 *    hold any number of default (NORMAL) mutexes.
 * 4) If the stack was created with a user specified stack ("stackaddr"
 *    attribute), the PTHREAD_DEBUG_THD_STACKADDR flag will be set. In this
 *    case, all of the thread's stack information fields, except stack_base
 *    and stack_hiwater, are guesses, and probably inaccurate. You shouldn't,
 *    for example, compare stack_hiwater against stack_reserve to check for
 *    stack overflows. If the stacksize attribute has also been modified in
 *    the attributes object, DECthreads will guess that the creator intended
 *    that as the size of the user stack. Because the standard does not
 *    specify any such relationship, this is still an unreliable guess.
 *    (There's no specific indication that both stackaddr and stacksize were
 *    set. However, if DECthreads must guess, we guess PTHREAD_STACK_MIN. So
 *    it's reasonable for you to guess that, if the stacksize of a user stack
 *    isn't PTHREAD_STACK_MIN, the user also specified a stacksize.)
 *
 *    However, if the flag PTHREAD_DEBUG_THD_ESTACKADDR is also set, then the
 *    "extended stackaddr" interface, pthread_setstackaddr_np, was used, which
 *    allows the caller to specify the size and base address. In this case,
 *    all stack information may be considered valid.
 * 5) There may be times during which a thread's signal state cannot be
 *    determined. The PTHREAD_DEBUG_THD_SIGNAL flag will be set if the
 *    thread's blocked and pending signal masks are valid. Otherwise, those
 *    fields will be 0, and should be ignored.
 * 6) There may be times when a thread's VP cannot be determined. At such
 *    time the "vp" field will have the value 0. No actual VP has the ID value 
 *    0.

/*
 *				 EVENTS
 *
 * The DECthreads event mechanism allows a debugger to determine when "things"
 * happen within the DECthreads scheduler. For example, when a thread is
 * created, when it first starts to run, and when it terminates.
 *
 * Ultimately the debugger learns of an event by receiving a breakpoint trap
 * that it has set within the "target" process. It can ask for the address of
 * a "hook" routine at which to set the breakpoint by calling the routine
 * pthreadDebugEventGetAddress. However, for performance reasons the
 * DECthreads scheduler does not normally call these hook routines. The hooks
 * must be enabled by setting events. Each hook point consists of a
 * single "non-operative" instruction followed by a return. A debugger may
 * REPLACE the initial instruction (a "bis r31,r31,v0") with a breakpoint, and 
 * need not replace or execute the original instruction when continuing from
 * the breakpoint.
 *
 * In principle, the debugger could begin by setting globally all events in
 * which it "may have" interest, and simply ignoring the resulting breakpoints
 * when an event isn't interesting at the moment. However, debugging of
 * asynchronous programs can be difficult enough without the timing impact of
 * dealing with extra breakpoints. It is strongly recommended that the
 * debugger enable only the events in which it is specifically interested, and
 * then disable them when it no longer needs to know.
 *
 * Additionally, when per-thread events are desired the debugger could simply
 * globally enable and disable any events, and check the current thread ID
 * during breakpoint processing. But to minimize the impact of events on
 * application behavior, it would be better to enable events only for specific
 * threads so that the breakpoint overhead occurs only where its likely to be
 * of use.
 */

/*
 *		Event definitions and "stub" prototypes
 *
 * Any of these events can be enabled either for specific threads or
 * "globally", for all threads in the target process. Note that disabling
 * (clearing) an event for a specific thread doesn't override a global enable
 * (or vice versa) -- events are reported if the event is enabled either
 * globally or for the current thread.
 *
 * Events are reported in either or both of two mechanisms, when the event
 * occurs while enabled.
 *
 * For the convenience of debuggers running in another process, DECthreads
 * calls a "breakpoint stub" in the target process -- a debugger may set
 * breakpoints at these calls to detect the event. Stub routine pointers are
 * returned by calling pthreadDebugEventGetAddress. Stubs are enabled by
 * getting a stub address, or by calling pthreadDebugEventSetGlobal or
 * pthreadDebugEventSetThread.
 *
 * For the convenience of code running within the threaded process, such as a
 * performance analyzer, DECthreads can be configured to call a hook routine
 * provided by the analyzer. You can set a hook address by calling
 * __pthread_debug_set_hook. (Note that although the "hook routine" event
 * interface is documented & prototyped in this header, the __pthread_debug_
 * routines are in libpthread.so [PTHREAD$RTL.EXE], not in the debug assistant
 * library.
 *
 * Each hook routine is called with arguments that identify the event, the
 * thread, and additional parameters giving specific information. Refer to the
 * pthreadDebugEventActivating_t routine prototype for the arguments passed to
 * the "Activating" event hook, for example.
 *
 *	ACTIVATING		Report the initial execution of a new thread
 *				(Setting this event for a specific thread is
 *				of minimal use, but is allowed: one example
 *				would be to enable it for the new thread
 *				reported in a Creating event, to determine
 *				when the new thread starts executing.)
 *	BLOCKING		Report when a thread blocks
 *	CREATING		Report when a thread is created
 *	RUNNING			Report when a thread runs (after blocking or
 *				preemption)
 *	TERMINATING		Report when a thread terminates (after a
 *				return from its start routine, a call to
 *				pthread_exit, or cancellation).  NOTE that
 *				the thread is not yet completely run down.
 *	INITIALIZED		Report when the DECthreads core has been
 *				initialized.
 *	FREEING			Report when a thread is going to be freed.
 *				This means a thread is completely run  down.
 *	UNBLOCK			Report when a thread is readied after
 *				having been blocked.
 *	BUGCHECK		Report when DECthreads bugchecks (panics)
 *	LASTCHANCE		Report when the last chance exception
 *				handler is invoked.
 *	TOOLTEXT		Report when a tool library detects some
 *				condition worth of debugger/user attention.
