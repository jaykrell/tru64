 *	The IMMED relocation identifies an address calculation embedded

 *	The r_size field holds a sub-opcode that identifies different
 *	types of address calculations.
 *
 *	R_IMMED_GP_16   	The identified instruction adds a 16-bit
 *	                 	displacement to the GP value, obtaining an
 *	                 	address.  The r_extern and r_symndx fields
 *	                 	specify the external symbol or section to

 *
 *	R_IMMED_GP_HI32 	The instruction is part of a pair of
 *	                	instructions that add a 32-bit displacement 
 *	                 	to the GP value.  This instruction adds
 *	                 	the high portion of the 32-bit displacement.
 *	                 	The next R_IMMED_LO32 identifies the
 *	                	instruction with the low portion of the
 *	                	displacement.  More than one subsequent

 *	                	fields of this relocation are not used.

 *	                 	add a 32-bit displacement to the starting
 *	                  	address of the current section.  This
 *	                  	instruction adds the high portion of the
 *	                  	displacement.  The next R_IMMED_LO32
 *	                 	identifies the instruction with the low
 *	                 	portion.  The r_extern and r_symndx
 *	                  	fields of this relocation are not used.
 *
 *	R_IMMED_BR_HI32  	The instruction is part of a pair that
 *	                	add a 32-bit displacement to the address
 *	                 	of the instruction following a branch
 *	                 	(br, bsr, jsr, or jmp).  The branch must
 *	                	preceed this instruction.  The r_symndx
 *	                	specifies a byte offset from r_vaddr to the 
 *	                	branch instruction.  This instruction
 *	                  	adds the high portion of the displacement.
 *	                  	The next R_IMMED_LO32 identifies the
 *	                 	instruction with the low portion.  The
 *	                 	r_extern field is not used.
 *
 *	R_IMMED_LO32     	The instruction is part of a pair that add
 *	                 	a 32-bit displacement to a base address.
 *	                 	This instruction adds the low portion of
 *	                	the displacement.  This relocation pairs
 *	                	with the previous R_IMMED_GP_HI32,
 *	                	R_IMMED_SCN_HI32, or R_IMMED_BR_HI32.
 *	                 	The r_extern and r_symndx fields specify
