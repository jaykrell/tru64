I haven't gotten gnutls to build.
I ended up finding it is "not needed".
git works with curl + openssl + openssh

Coming back to this..still would be nice to have wget..

  $ $HOME/s/gnutls-3.6.16/configure -prefix=$HOME -disable-nls -verbose \
    -with-included-libtasn1 \
    -without-p11-kit \
    LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/lib -rpath $HOME/lib" CFLAGS=-pthread

building gnutls with its included minitasn1:

/usr/users/jay/s/gnutls-3.6.16/lib/minitasn1/../crypto-backend.h:31:27:
  fatal error: gnutls/crypto.h: No such file or directory

solution:
 make install
 Yeah, ahead of make succeeding.

 Or rather... regular libtasn is easy to build..there is an error
 in a program/example, due to getlong_opt (suggest gnulib?) but
 make -k install installs plenty.

/usr/users/jay/s/gnutls-3.6.16/lib/hash_int.c: In function '_gnutls_hash_init':

This is a problem I faced/patched elsewhere in gnutls:
  gnutls_digest_algorithm_t
put "enum " in front of it? That does not work.

Still no luck.
